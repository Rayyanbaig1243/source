## Overview

Welcome to the **Source Engine: Community Edition**, an open-source initiative based on the 2018 leaked source code of *Team Fortress 2*. This project serves as a learning platform for C++ development and game engine architecture, primarily focusing on the famous Source Engine developed by Valve. The engine, which succeeded GoldSrc, first appeared with *Half-Life: Source* in June 2004 and was later used in popular titles like *Counter-Strike: Source* and *Half-Life 2*.

This project is for **educational purposes only**. As I am still learning, there might be some mistakes in the codebase. Contributions, feedback, and maintenance help from the community are highly encouraged and deeply appreciated.

> **Important Notice:** This code is provided as-is for learning and experimentation. It is not intended for commercial use, and any commercial application of this code is strictly prohibited.

For a more comprehensive overview of the Source engine, please refer to its [Wikipedia page](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(game_engine)).

## Build System

This project currently uses the **WAF build system** to compile and manage the source code. WAF is a powerful and flexible build system designed to handle complex build environments. If you have any questions or run into issues with WAF, I recommend consulting the [WAF Book](https://waf.io/book) for detailed guidance.

## Contributing and Feedback

As this is a learning project, I'm constantly striving to improve the codebase and expand my knowledge. I welcome any contributions, whether it’s fixing bugs, improving documentation, or adding new features. Your feedback and suggestions are invaluable to me, and I would be grateful for any assistance in maintaining and enhancing this project.
